# Schedule-Matcher

A program that takes 2 ordered schedules (sequences) and finds the longest sub-schedule where both parties can enjoy some common activities without betraying their ordering. Surprisingly useful for planning movie marathons, among other hobbies.

# Applications
1. You want to watch all the Star Wars movies in release order, but your friend wants to watch them in chronological order. You two would still like to watch
   as many of them as possible together, without betraying your respective orders.

3. You and your friend are tagging alongside separate groups at a carnival. Each group has their own schedule of carnival rides that they'd like to get through. 
   However, you and your friend would like to enjoy some rides together without leaving your respective groups. The program returns the maximum number of rides
   you two can ride together without forcing your groups to change the order of their schedule.
